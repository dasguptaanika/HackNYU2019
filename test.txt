EBSF accommodates several approaches to extraction-based summarization, which can either be used separately or aggregated into one summarization workflow. Although designed for extractionbased query-focused multi-document summarization, the framework can be configured to perform other summarization tasks, such as single-document summarization or summarization without a query. The implemented summarizer is purely extractive, meaning that no sentence realization techniques mentioned in section 2.8 have been implemented. The reason for this is the complexity of such techniques, hence the time it would need to implement them. Sentence ordering is not implemented either. The primary focus of the implemented system is, as with most other extraction-based summarization systems, the content selection mechanism, the procedure of deciding which sentences should be included in the summary. Typically, each sentence is assigned a score and sentences with high scores are selected. The overall workflow of the implemented system is shown in figure 4.1. Not all the steps that appear in the diagram are absolutely required to produce a summary. Some of the steps can be omitted depending on the configuration. The rest of this section describes each of the steps shown in the diagram
