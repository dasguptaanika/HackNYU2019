Looks like it's going to be another one of those Fridays, at least in Washington.

Let's try to get our arms around it all:

President Trump is expected to sign that compromise border security
bill this morning in the Rose Garden. Then, he'll declare a national
emergency on the border with Mexico and use executive action to
cobble together $8 billion to build a border wall, White House officials
say.

So, as one crisis is averted (no partial government shutdown), another
one begins. Democrats and some Republicans say this would be an
unprecedented use of presidential power, and this constitutional dispute
will likely get tied up in the courts. (Fun fact: Way back in 2014, Donald
Trump said President Obama's executive action on immigration was

unconstitutional and possibly an impeachable offense.)
