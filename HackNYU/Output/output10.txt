Regulation in the Economy and in Everyday Life

‘The notion that the American economy is largely a “free enterprise” system, unfet-
tered by government intervention, is about as up to date as a Madel T Ford. You can
begin to understand the sweeping scope of governmental regulation by examining
haw the automobile industry is regulated:

+ The Securities and Exchange Commission regulates buying and selling stock in an
automobile corporation,

+ Relations between the workers and managers of the company came under the
scrutiny of the National Labor Relations Board.

‘* The Department of Labar and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
mandate affirmative action in hiring workers in automobile production plants
‘because automakers are major government contractors.

* The EPA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and the
Department of Transportation require that cars include pollution-control, energy-
saving, and safety devices.

‘Unfair advertising and deceptive consumer practices in marketing cars come un-
der the watchful eye of the FTC.

From the beginnings of the American republic until 1887, the federal government
made almost no regulatory policies. The litte regulation that was produced originated
with state and local authorities, and opponents disputed even the minimal regula-
tory powers of state and local governments. In 1877, the Supreme Court upheld the
right of government to regulate the business operations of a firm. The case, Mun
Hiinois, evolved the right of the state of Dlinois to regulate the charges and services of
a Chicago warehouse. Farmers at this time were seething about alleged overcharging
by railroads, grain elevator companies, and other business firms. In 1887—a decade
after Munn—Congress created the first regulatory agency, the Interstate Commerce
Commission (ICC), and charged it with regulating the railroads, their prices, and their
services to farmers; the ICC thus set the precedent for regulatory policymaking.
